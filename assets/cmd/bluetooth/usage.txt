!!!!! scan devices !!!!!
hcitool scan

if there is an error then the bluetooth needs to be powered on
run this to power it on
./power.sh on
--------------------



!!!!! connect device !!!!!
bluez5-connect xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (this is python so no need to put bash at the begining)
this will connect the device but you must disable the player before doing this then enable the player after, 

this is my working php example
<?php
$output = shell_exec("./bluetooth/bluez5-connect FC:58:FA:48:0B:5E");
if (strpos($output, 'org.bluez.Error.Failed') !== false) {
    echo 'failed';
}
else{
echo "connected";
}
?>

------------------------
!!!!! disconnect button !!!!!
bash ./bluetooth/disconnect.sh
expect the message (done) then you should alert (all devices disconnected)

------------------------
!!!!! unpair-all button !!!!!
bash ./bluetooth/unpair-all.sh

same again wait for (done) then if possible check the output from shell_exec and count how many (Device has been removed) there are
so you can alert (3 devices removed) if 3 are found
