---------------------------------------------------------
These are for bugs and cosmetic fixes that will need doing, they are extras so note down who done it and how much 

cosmetic issues:

scrollbar: i would like the scrollbar to be wider. as wide as the volume slider please

settings: could we have a on/off slider switch for the speakers. there is a script to get the state of the speaker (/assets/cmd/get_spearker_active.sh) 0=off 1=on

bugs:
player: when changing tracks sometimes it will hang on (loading...) im guessing it didnt load the track in time, maybe a function to check that the track is playing correctly

---------------------------------------------------------

album uploader: on the final modal could you swap the artist title around so artist in on top, and replace the success message with something better. maybe a "Success" in the header or something
## Stefano : 13/08/2016

download album: the zip file name does not contain spaces. for instance (avril lavigne - let go) would be name AvrilLavigne-Letgo.zip needs spaces
## Stefano : 13/08/2016

radio stations.

both of these need a "are you sure" function.

>>>>

you will need to check for a blank cd and check its size then calculate how many cd's would be needed and give the user this info in a modal.
the album would be converted to wav files then burnt to cd one disc at a time.
simple progress bar and user to be alerted for changing disc.
note that there are about 3 different sizes of blank cd's.
idealy we would have the album already devided into cd's but would be good to check that they will fit on the blank cd.
this script will also be used for burning playlists to cd's

#cd rip - ### STEFANO 18/01/2015 ### <paid> +£100 for effort

you will need to make the cd ripper rip the wav files from audio cd and convert them to mp3. also check the internet for track names by using the cd 
info id. also try and auto retrieve the image/cover. then add the album to the database.
this will also need the ability to rename all tracks and search online for images.(the image search funtion would be made first).
also like the album upload we would also allow the user to add more cd's to the album before finishing.
this will need a simple progress bar.

there is a perl script that works well called ripit.pl that code is very useful :)
